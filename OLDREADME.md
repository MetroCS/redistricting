# Redistricting a Geographic Region into Election Districts

Objective: A computer program designed to split a given geographic region into election districts.

## Region

The program is given a specified region a two-dimensional grid of locations (using row and column indices).  Each location represents the voters residing at that location.  Each voter is identified by their party affiliation.  An example of such a region is given here.

In this example the region is a 5x5 grid of locations. There is exactly one voter associated with each location. Each voter is affiliated with either Party A or Party B. Voters associated with Party A occupy grid locations (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4). All other locations are occupied by voters associated with Party B.

## Districts

The program must divide the region into a _specified number of districts_. Each district must contain the _same number of voters_ as all other districts within practical constraints (e.g., allows off-by-one where the number of voters is not evenly divisible by the number of districts).

A district can be represented as a set of grid coordinates.  For example { (0,0, (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) } could represent a district comprised of the four locations in the upper-left part of the example region.

Districts must be _non-overlapping_ and _contiguous_. That is, each location within the same district must share an edge with at least one other location in that district.

For example, if the number of districts specified for the example region is 5, one such outcome would simply divide the grid into rows.  In this case, each district is made up of the set of locations { (i, 0), (i, 1), (i, 2), (i, 3), (i, 4) }, where i specifies a row index 0 ≤ i < 5.

## Favored Party

In each district, the party with the most voters is "favored". In the previous example (districts determined by row), only the district represented by the second row, i == 1, favors Party A. Each of the other districts favors Party B.

If the most number of voters is the same for more than one party, then there is no favored party.

 

## Gerrymandering

The term gerrymandering refers to dividing a region into districts with the intent of giving an advantage to one party. This is done by maximizing the number of districts in which that party is favored (where the party has a majority of voters) and minimizing the number of districts in which an opposition party is favored.

 

### Party Preference Parameter

The program may be given a party preference and will attempt to create districts such that the maximum number of districts favor the preferred party. If no party preference is given then the program will attempt to balance the number of districts favored by each party.

Using the example region, the program was asked to create five districts. It produced the following two outcomes demonstrating that either of the two parties could have a majority of the districts.

Run A Districts:  {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)}, {(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3)}, {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)}, {(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)}, {(3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}

Run B Districts:  {(0, i), (1, i), (2, i), (3, i), (4, i)}, where i specifies a column index 0 ≤ i < 5.

Run A defines 3 districts with preference to Party A, 2 districts with preference to party B, so results in a region preference to Party A.

Run B defines all 5 districts with preference to Party B, so results in a region preference to Party B.

# Product
The desired product is a maintainable application that addresses the described redistricting activity, produced using an appropriate software development process.

Early versions of the product may utilize some or all of the following simplifications (preconditions):

* The region is represented by a rectangular grid.
* The number of voters at each location is exactly 1.
* The number of districts is a proper divisor of the number of locations in the grid.
* There are exactly two parties.
  * If the number of voters in a district is even, and the number of voters associated with each party in a district is the same, then neither party is favored in that district.
